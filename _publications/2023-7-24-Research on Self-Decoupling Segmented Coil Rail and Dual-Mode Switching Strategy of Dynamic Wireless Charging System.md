excerpt: 'In this paper, a dynamic wireless charging system for electric vehicles with self-decoupling segmented transmitter coils is presented. To this end, based on the naturally decoupling orthogonal solenoid and square coils, the solenoid and square coils are hierarchically connected in series to form the transmitter coil, eliminating the cross-coupling effects of the adjacent transmitter coils on the design of the compensation topology. To obtain a stable charging performance, a two-mode working method, where one or two transmitter coils are activated, is proposed based on the optimal charging area. A solenoid-detecting coil orthogonal wounded on the receiver coil is designed to detect the position of the receiver. The natural decoupling feature avoids the interference between the detection signal and power delivery. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed design are evaluated based on a scaled-down prototype. The experimental results show that the stability of the system output power is improved by 19.5%, and the maximum efficiency of the system can reach 92.3%.'
