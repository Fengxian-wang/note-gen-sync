**What - Clarification of the Core Content:**

- This study proposes a method to regulate the near-field electromagnetic energy flow in a wireless power transfer (WPT) system by adjusting the system's working frequency, aiming to improve power transfer capability and efficiency under misaligned conditions.
- The research focuses on the comprehensive utilization of both magnetic field coupled power (MFCP) and electric field coupled power (EFCP) in the near-field WPT system to enhance its grid interaction capabilities.
- The paper describes the energy flow process of the near-field WPT system using Poynting vector analysis and proposes a reduced-order evaluation method to assess the transmission levels of MFCP and EFCP.
- The study aims to provide a new method for realizing complementary output and ratio regulation of the two types of coupled power using couplers made of simple materials.

**Why - Analysis of the Purpose:**

- The integration of large-scale WPT systems into the power grid poses challenges due to the decrease in output characteristics caused by coupling misalignment.
- The study seeks to address this issue by exploring a method to regulate the electromagnetic energy flow in the near-field WPT system, thereby improving its stability and efficiency under misaligned conditions.
- The research aims to enhance the grid interaction capabilities of electric equipment equipped with near-field WPT systems by utilizing both MFCP and EFCP.
- The goal is to provide a practical solution for improving the output characteristics of WPT systems using simple materials and minimal coupler size.

**How - Description of the Methods Used:**

- The paper employs Poynting vector analysis to describe the electromagnetic energy flow process in the near-field WPT system, considering the effects of distributed parameters.
- A reduced-order evaluation method is proposed to assess the transmission levels of MFCP and EFCP.
- The study uses an equivalent circuit model of the WPT system with coils as transmission carriers to analyze the transmission ratio between the two types of coupled power.
- Simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for regulating the near-field electromagnetic energy flow by adjusting the working frequency.

**Key Findings and Insights:**

- The transmission ratio between MFCP and EFCP is proportional to the square of the working frequency, and the EFCP transmission channel is less sensitive to positional misalignment.
- By increasing the working frequency, the proportion of EFCP in the total electromagnetic power transmitted by the system increases, enhancing the system's misalignment tolerance.
- The experimental results show that the system efficiency (AC-AC) improves with increasing working frequency, and the misalignment resistance is enhanced by up to 13.2% when the working frequency is increased from 100 kHz to 400 kHz.
- The proposed method effectively regulates the near-field electromagnetic energy flow, ensuring optimal output characteristics under coupling misalignment.

**Examples of Critical Solutions Proposed:**

- The study proposes a method to regulate the near-field electromagnetic energy flow by adjusting the system's working frequency, which actively changes the transmission ratio between MFCP and EFCP.
- The introduction of EFCP compensates for the decreased total electromagnetic power due to coupling misalignment, improving the system's output characteristics.
- The use of a coupler consisting of simple materials (e.g., planar coils) allows for the complementary output of MFCP and EFCP, enhancing the stability of the WPT system under misaligned conditions.

**Research Gaps and Future Work:**

- While the study provides a method to regulate the electromagnetic energy flow using frequency adjustment, further research is needed to explore other potential methods and their effects on system performance.
- The impact of different coupling materials and their properties on the transmission ratio and system efficiency should be investigated in future work.
- The study's results offer a foundation for further exploration into the optimization of coupler design and system control strategies to enhance the overall performance and reliability of WPT systems under various operating conditions.
