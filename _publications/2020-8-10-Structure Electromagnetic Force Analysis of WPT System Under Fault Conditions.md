excerpt: 'In the high-frequency electromagnetic field, the coupling of the wireless power transfer (WPT) system is affected by the electromagnetic force (EMF). The fault conditions will strengthen the influence, cause the damage of magnetic shielding structure, coil deformation, insulation damage and so on. In order to ensure the safe and stable operation of the WPT system, it is necessary to study the local EMF distribution of the coupling mechanism under the fault condition of WPT system. In this paper, the series to series (SS) compensation structure is taken as an example to analyze the changes of electrical parameters of WPT system under typical faults, and determines that the open load fault has the greatest impact on the system. The WPT system with groove-shaped magnetic shield structure is selected as the research object. Establish a mathematical model for calculating the EMF of the WPT system combining the field-path coupling time-step finite element method and the Maxwell stress method, the distribution law of local EMF of magnetic shielding structure when the load is open is analyzed and calculated. At the same time, an experimental platform is built to verify the effectiveness of the method. According to the distribution characteristics of EMF, the smoothing scheme based on variable-turn-pitch planar coil is proposed. The new coil structure obtained by the SNOPT algorithm, compared with the equi-turn-pitch planar coil, the overall force on the coupling mechanism of transmitting end under the open circuit fault at the receiving end is reduced by 86.24%. This study provides a theoretical reference for the optimal design of coupling mechanism of WPT system.'

**What - Clarification of the Core Content:**



- This study investigates the electromagnetic force (EMF) distribution within the coupling mechanism of a wireless power transfer (WPT) system during fault conditions, focusing on the impact of such forces.
- The study emphasizes the importance of the safe and stable operation of WPT systems, especially under fault conditions that intensify the influence of EMF.
- The series to series (SS) compensation structure is used as an example to analyze the WPT system's electrical parameters during typical faults.
- It identifies that an open load fault affects the system the most, leading to damage to magnetic shielding structures and coil deformations.
- A mathematical model combining field-path coupling and Maxwell stress methods is established to calculate the EMF of the WPT system.



**Why - Analysis of the Purpose:**

- The open circuit fault is crucial to study due to its potential to cause significant current oscillations in the system, resulting in increased EMF.
- The study aims to provide theoretical support for the optimal design of the coupling mechanism in WPT systems to mitigate the adverse effects of EMF during faults.



**How - Description of the Methods Used:**

- A simulation model is constructed to analyze the magnetic induction strength and surface stress distribution of the system.
- Experimental validation is executed, confirming theoretical predictions of EMF distribution when subjected to faults.
- A variable-turn-pitch planar coil is introduced as a smoothing scheme to control the magnetic induction strength distribution and reduce EMF.



**Key Findings and Insights:**

- The study found that the magnetic induction strength and surface stress were consistent, and both were related to the distribution of the coil currents.
- The EMF amplitude ratio before and after the fault is about the square of the fault current ratio, indicating a significant increase in EMF during faults.
-  The experimental results are in line with the simulated findings, substantiating the theoretical modeling approach.



**Examples of Critical Solutions Proposed:**

- The introduced variable-turn-pitch planar coil, enhanced using the SNOPT algorithm, had a notable effect, reducing the force on the transmission-side coupling mechanism under open circuit faults by 86.24% when compared to equi-turn-pitch planar coils.

- The study demonstrates the practicality of the proposed smoothing scheme by showing the restraint capability of the optimized coil structure.

  

**Research Gaps and Future Work:**

- While the study delves into the EMF during specific fault conditions, the analysis of other potential faults and conditions affecting WPT systems is suggested for future research.
- The study's results offer a foundation for further exploration into structural optimization and material science to enhance WPT system resilience against EMF.
