excerpt: 'This article proposes a solution for driving a microdisplacement device in the coupling space of a wireless power transfer system. The solution involves using a levitation device made of a combination of Fe-based nanocrystalline alloys (Fe-NCS) and aluminium. The dynamic model of the levitation device is analyzed to understand the electromagnetic force involved, and an optimized grid-type Fe-NCS structure is proposed to reduce the weight of the device and achieve stable levitation. The optimization uses a variable acceleration particle swarm optimization algorithm. A 3.7-kW prototype with 100-A input current is built to validate the proposed structure, and the results show that the optimized grid-type structure effectively enhances the average horizontal velocity of the levitation drive to 9.3 cm/s.'
